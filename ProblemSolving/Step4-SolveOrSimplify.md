## Step 4 - Solve or simplify

- Try to ignore the part what you're stuck with
- Concentrate on the part you can work on

### Simplify
1. Find the core diffty in what you're trying to do
2. Temporarily ignore that diffty
3. Write a simplified solution
4. Incorporate that diffcty back in

### Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each character in the string
