## Step 3 - Break it down

Explicitly write out the steps you need to take


### Write a function which takes a string and return the count of each of the characters

```javascript
function charCount (str) {
  // make object of the response
  // loop over string for each character
    // if the char is a key in obj, add one to count
    // if the char is not a key in obj, add it and set value to 1
    // if key is something other than letter/number, do not do anything
  // return object
}
```
