# Logarithms

## What are Logarithms
log subscript 2 = log_2
log_2(8) = 3 ----> 2^3=8

log_2(value) = exponent ----> 2_exponent=value

For complexity --- log_n === log

## Scale for complexities
O(1) < O(log n) < O(n) < O(nlog n) < O(n^2)

## Where they show up
Which algorithms would have log complexity:
- Searching
- Sorting
- Recursion
